#### Connecting the Legal and Ethereal Worlds through Entity Formation

Legal entities are a way for us - whether we be a human, or a DAO - to interact with the 'real' world.

This system is designed to give anyone rapid and inexpensive access to legal entity formation. It accomplishes this through a 'Series LLC'; a legal entity with potentially thousands of 'child' entities, which can be assigned to owners.

A user can sign the legal agreement with their Polkadot browser extension, and creates an artifact on chain that can be used as proof of ownership.
